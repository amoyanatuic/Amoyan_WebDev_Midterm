       <p style="text-align:center;">Nobody can transform You <br> 
       not him, not them 
       or anyone <br> 
       can transform You.
           <br />
       <p style="text-align:center;">Be who you are, remain as such, <br>
       regular is another day <br> 
       try not to let yourself blur away.
           <br />
       <p style="text-align:center;">In that moment <br>
       you will be the ideal one, <br>
       Be that as it may, <br>
       you need to acknowledge <br>  
       them as well.
           <br />
       <p style="text-align:center;">Simply strive what you got, <br>
       at that point, <br> 
       you will see <br>
       the genuine you.
           <br />
       <p style="text-align:center;">Yet, consistently recollect <br> 
       nobody can compare you <br> 
       than who are you <br> 
       expectation you realize that as well. <br />
